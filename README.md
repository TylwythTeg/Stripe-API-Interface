# Stripe API Interface

This is a simple tool that allows you to make quick Stripe API requests with JSON using test API keys. Very useful for testing and getting a feel for the API without the hassle of setting up an environment. Includes templates for various outcomes and a log tab that holds data from the last 30 calls as well as links to the relevant section of the API Reference on Stripe's website for further study.
